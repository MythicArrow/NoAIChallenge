## ‚úÖ **ML/AI Engineer FAANG-Ready Checklist (Future-Proof Edition)**

---

### üß† CORE TECHNICAL MASTERY (Theory & Practice)

* [ ] **Math for ML**

  * Linear Algebra (matrix operations, eigenvectors, SVD)
  * Probability & Stats (Bayes Rule, distributions, hypothesis testing)
  * Calculus (gradients, chain rule)
  * Optimization (SGD, Adam, convexity)

* [ ] **Machine Learning Algorithms**

  * Classical ML (Random Forests, XGBoost, SVM, KMeans)
  * Bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, feature engineering

* [ ] **Deep Learning**

  * CNNs, RNNs, Transformers (from scratch and with libraries)
  * Overfitting, dropout, batch/layer norm, learning rate schedules

* [ ] **Large Language Models (LLMs)**

  * Understand Transformer architecture in detail
  * Fine-tuning vs instruction-tuning vs in-context learning
  * Tokenization, positional encoding, attention mechanisms

* [ ] **RL & Decision-Making**

  * Policy gradients, Q-learning, PPO, actor-critic
  * Exploration vs exploitation
  * Applications in games, robotics, recommendations

---

### üõ† SYSTEMS & ENGINEERING SKILLS (What FAANG Really Cares About)

* [ ] **MLOps & Deployment**

  * MLflow / Kubeflow / Weights & Biases
  * Model versioning, reproducibility, drift detection
  * Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform basics

* [ ] **CI/CD for ML**

  * GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for model training & testing
  * Unit + integration tests for ML pipelines

* [ ] **Serving & Scaling**

  * FastAPI / gRPC for inference endpoints
  * Load testing, A/B testing, rollout strategies

* [ ] **Data Engineering Foundations**

  * ETL with Airflow / Dagster
  * Working with data lakes, feature stores, SQL/noSQL

* [ ] **Cloud ML Infrastructure**

  * AWS/GCP/Azure for training + deployment (SageMaker, Vertex AI)
  * Spot vs on-demand, cost optimizations

---

### üî¨ RESEARCH + DEEP WORK

* [ ] Reproduce 2‚Äì3 top ML papers (ICLR, NeurIPS, CVPR)
* [ ] Write detailed blog posts explaining them
* [ ] Build a small improvement or real-world extension
* [ ] Bonus: open-source the code & put it on GitHub with stars

---

### üîç DOMAIN & EDGE SKILLS

* [ ] **LLM Tools**

  * LangChain / Haystack / LlamaIndex
  * Build RAG systems and agents that talk to APIs/tools

* [ ] **Multimodal ML**

  * Combine text, image, audio input
  * Use CLIP, DALL¬∑E, Whisper, etc.

* [ ] **Graph ML & Recommenders**

  * Use PyTorch Geometric or DGL
  * Build recommendation systems, fraud detectors, etc.

* [ ] **Robotics or Sim2Real (optional but cutting-edge)**

  * MuJoCo / PyBullet + RL + domain adaptation

---

### üß∞ PROJECTS (at least 3 of these)

* [ ] ‚úÖ LLM-powered agent with RAG and tool use
* [ ] ‚úÖ End-to-end MLOps pipeline with CI/CD, drift detection, and auto-retraining
* [ ] ‚úÖ Graph-based recommendation or fraud detection system
* [ ] ‚úÖ Reinforcement learning agent with real-world transfer
* [ ] ‚úÖ Multimodal search engine (text, audio, image input)
* [ ] ‚úÖ Reproduced and extended a recent ML paper
* [ ] ‚úÖ LLM fine-tuning project with LoRA or QLoRA
* [ ] ‚úÖ Code assistant (autocomplete, static analysis) using CodeBERT or GPT-2 model

---

### üíº CAREER / FAANG READINESS

* [ ] Leetcode grind: 150+ problems, all key patterns
* [ ] System design prep: ML system design (not just CRUD)
* [ ] Real-world project portfolio on GitHub + personal site
* [ ] Medium/Blog posts explaining your projects clearly
* [ ] Kaggle competition top 10% in 1-2 challenges (optional but strong signal)
* [ ] Contributed to an open-source ML repo (e.g. HuggingFace, Haystack)
* [ ] Resume + LinkedIn optimized with keywords, metrics, and links
* [ ] Mock interviews (DS/ML + behavioral)
* [ ] Referral network built via LinkedIn, communities, and open-source

---

### üß† MINDSET & STRATEGY

* [ ] Learn fast, experiment boldly, document everything
* [ ] Don‚Äôt chase hype‚Äîbuild things that solve real problems
* [ ] Think like a **founder**, not just a data scientist
* [ ] Track trends (e.g., model compression, AI agents, alignment) and specialize wisely
* [ ] Practice articulating your decisions like an engineer: tradeoffs, constraints, scaling

---

## üèÅ Final Goal:

‚úÖ Portfolio = 3+ production-grade, blogged, open-source projects
‚úÖ GitHub = active, clean, well-documented repos
‚úÖ Interviews = nailed system design, ML theory, and coding
‚úÖ Network = FAANG referrals & strong LinkedIn presence
‚úÖ Tech = Fluent in LLMs, MLOps, classic ML, and deployment
